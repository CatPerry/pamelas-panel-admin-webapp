I've designed a School Administrator's app that allows the admin to manage students, teachers, courses, and cohorts. 

This has been drafted as the MVP (minimum viable product) without a login, though I intend to use either Clearance or Devise for it, and I was focusing on the database realationships foremost. This admin panel was built without using a Ruby Gem that does this exact thing.
